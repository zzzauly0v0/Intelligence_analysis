"""Shared asyncpg pool for the deep-research TODO planner.

The ``pydantic-ai-todo`` async storage backend speaks raw asyncpg (DSN or pool),
not SQLAlchemy, and only its async backends emit the lifecycle events that drive
the live research checklist. One process-wide pool is created in the app lifespan
against the same Postgres as the ORM and handed to a per-conversation
``AsyncPostgresStorage`` keyed by ``session_id``. ``None`` when the pool could not
be created, in which case callers fall back to in-memory storage.
